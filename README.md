# smart-brain-app
<p>This is a smart brain application that allows users to input an image and detect faces within it. To create this app, I used a variety of programming languages and technologies, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>HTML5</strong> and <strong>CSS3</strong> for the front-end design and layout</li>
  <li><strong>EcmaScript</strong>, <strong>ReactJS</strong>, <strong>NodeJS</strong>, and <strong>Express</strong> for the back-end development and logic</li>
  <li><strong>PostgreSQL</strong> for the database management</li>
  <li>API's such as <strong>Clarifai</strong> for image recognition</li>
</ul>
<p>It is important to note that in order to use the Clarifai API, you will need to provide your own API key. This key can be obtained from the Clarifai website. The key should be placed in the <strong>controllers > image.js</strong> file within the project.</p>
